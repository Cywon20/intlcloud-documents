## Feature Overview
CI uses the **imageMogr2** API to adjust the brightness of an image.

An image can be processed:

- Upon download
- Upon upload
- In cloud

## Restrictions

- Format: JPG, BMP, GIF, PNG, and WebP images can be processed, and HEIF images can be decoded and processed.
- Size: The input image cannot be larger than 32 MB, with its width and height not exceeding 30,000 pixels, and the total number of pixels not exceeding 250 million. The width and height of the output image cannot exceed 9,999 pixels. For an input animated image, the total number of pixels (Width x Height x Number of frames) cannot exceed 250 million pixels.
- Number of frames (for animated images): For GIF, the number of frames cannot exceed 300.


## API Format

#### 1. Processing upon download

```plaintext
download_url?imageMogr2/bright/<value>					
```

#### 2. Processing upon upload

```plaintext
PUT /<ObjectKey> HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
  "is_pic_info": 1,
  "rules": [{
      "fileid": "exampleobject",
      "rule": "imageMogr2/bright/<value>"
  }]
}
```

>? `Pic-Operations` is a JSON string. Its parameters are as described in [Persistent Image Processing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33695).
>

#### 3. Processing in-cloud data

```plaintext
POST /<ObjectKey>?image_process HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Content-length: Size
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
  "is_pic_info": 1,
  "rules": [{
      "fileid": "exampleobject",
      "rule": "imageMogr2/bright/<value>"
  }]
}
```


>? 
> - Authorization: Auth String (See [Request Signature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7778) for details.)
> - When this feature is used by a sub-account, relevant permissions must be granted.

## Parameters

Operation: bright

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| download_url | URL of the input image, formatted as `&lt;BucketName-APPID>.cos.&lt;Region>.myqcloud.com/&lt;picture name>`<br>Example: `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/picture.jpeg` |
| bright/&lt;value> | Adjusts the brightness of an image. The value must be an integer in the range of [−100, 100]. <br><li>`value` < 0: reduces the brightness. </li><li>`value` = 0: does not adjust the brightness. </li><li>`value` > 0: increases the brightness. </li> |
| /ignore-error/1 | If this parameter is carried and the image failed to be processed because the image size or the parameter value is too large, the input image will be returned with no error reported. |

## Examples

>? **Processing upon download** is used as an example here, which does not store the output image in a bucket. If you need to store the output image, see [Persistent Image Processing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33695) and use **Processing upon upload** or **Processing in-cloud data**.

#### Example 1: Adjusting brightness

This example increases the brightness of an image by 70:

```plaintext

```

Output image:

#### Example 2: Adjusting brightness with a signature carried

This example processes the image in the same way as in the example above except that a signature is carried. The signature is joined with other processing parameters using an ampersand (&).

```plaintext
http://examples-1251000004.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.jpeg?q-sign-algorithm=<signature>&imageMogr2/bright/70
```

>? You can obtain the value of `<signature>` by referring to [Request Signature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7778).
>

## Notes

To prevent unauthorized users from accessing or downloading the input image by using a URL that does not contain any processing parameter, you can add the processing parameters to the request signature, making the processing parameters the key of the parameter with the value left empty. The following is a simple example for your reference (it might have expired or become inaccessible).
